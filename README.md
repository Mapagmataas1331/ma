## Overview

This is my personal resume website, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects. It serves as a digital portfolio, providing a platform for others to learn more about my work as a developer and the journey I’ve taken. The website highlights various aspects of my career, technical expertise, and creative endeavors.

## Functional Description

This website is built using [**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev/), a modern web framework that delivers fast and dynamic interfaces with minimal effort. The UI design is based on a port of the popular [**shadcn UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for Svelte, available at [shadcn-svelte.com](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com). The site combines a minimalistic aesthetic with functional, interactive components for a seamless user experience.
